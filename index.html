      <strong>Rugby</strong>
      I have been playing rugby since I was 8 with Clondalkin RFC.
      I have made lifelong friendships and learned many valuable lessons.
      I proudly sepent the 2015 season serving as club captain
      Being a part on the club has allowed me to develop
      leadership and interpersonal skills and shown me the importance of community.
      I have organised serveral successful fundraising and charity events within the club,
      includeing a 100km Challenge which raises nearly â‚¬10,000 for 4 local causes.
      I have also MC'd the annual Captain's Dinner, which gives me a real platform to try out my stand-up routine.
      <br />
      <strong>Music</strong>
      I grew up in a very musical household, and in my youth managed to get up to Grade 7 Piano with the Royal Irish Academy of Music.
      Once I get my act together, and my own piano, I will go back and complete the remaining Grades.
      I also learned to play the guitar and drums, and have played live and recorded in many bands. A selection of these recordings can be found here, here and quite possibly here, here and here
      I have a keen interest in live music, especially where stage dives are involved.
      <br />
      <strong>Design</strong>
      While I am by no means a professional, I really enjoy creating digital images and designing logos. I'm hoping this playgroug shows some of my capabilities.
      I have designed logos for professional and personal use, and always enjoy the creative process.

      <h2>DOGS!</h2>
      The dogs myself and my partner have adopted. I would always encourage to adopt, don't shop!<br />
      The images were digitally drawn in GIMP - GNU Image Manipulation Program - An open source cross-platform image editor.
      <div class="dog-row">
        <img class="dog-pic dog-pic-left" src="Images/Bran.jpg" alt="Bran the dog, RIP">
        <p class="dog-text">This is Bran. We adopted him when he was a very old, skittish, blind boy from Dogs Trust. He had a list of ailments a mile long, but loved to cuddle and chew on his toys. He was only with us for a short time, but he was
          lovely. Good boy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="dog-row">
        <img class="dog-pic dog-pic-right" src="Images/Roux.jpg" alt="Roux the dog">
        <p class="dog-text">Roux is our Collie cross from the DSPCA. She loves walkies, but hates cars. She loves ball. She is a very lovely clever girl, with a very good manner, great with other dogs and is ultra focussed on ball. Where is the ball?
          When are you going to throw the ball? Why aren't you throwing the ball now? Good girl.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="dog-row">
        <img class="dog-pic dog-pic-left" src="Images/chief.jpg" alt="Chief the dog">
        <p class="dog-text">Chief is our Saluki pup. We adoped him at the start of Lockdown 1, and named him after the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan. He came from Wicklow Animal Welfare, who found him abondoned at the side of the road when
          he was only a couple of weeks old. As a result, he has very bad separation anxiety. but it also means he is really affectionate and loves people and other dogs. Good boy. </p>

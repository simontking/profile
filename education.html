          Way back in 2010, when I was fresh out of secondary school, I attended ITT Dublin where I studied Electronic Engineering, initially as a 2 year Diploma, but eventually completed the 5 year Bachelors Program.
          The course had a wide range of topics covered. I gained a strong foundation in Mathmatics and Electrical Science, with modules in semiconductor technology, networking, communications, digital signal processing.
          There was plenty of practical work designing circuits and playing around with electronics, plenty of presentations, which honed the skills required to convince a room full of people you know what you're talking about, but I found the
          software
          modules most interesting.
          Some of the modules covered:
          <ul>
            <li>Mathematics</li>
            <li>Datacommunications</li>
            <li>Engineering Software (C++)</li>
            <li>VLSI Design</li>
            <li>Structured Design for Quality</li>
            <li>Embedded Software (C++)</li>
            <li>Computer Programming (JAVA)</li>
            <li>Physics</li>
            <li>Electrical Science</li>
            <li>Analogue & Digital Electronics</li>
          </ul>
          Electronic Engineering was not my first choice, I had intially intended on doing Computer Science with Arts in UCD, but the course filled before I could get a place.
          However, I persisted with some of the less interest0ing modules and learned a lot of interesting things I otherwise may not have ever been exposed to.
          Most importantly I gained some excellent friendships. I learned some invaluable life lessons throughout from those fine people. We dragged each other through labs and exams, had many a fine social evening, travelled across America together
          on
          a J1, grown into real life human people.
          Shout out, my boys!

          <strong>University College Dublin</strong><br />

          In 2016, I decided to get a formal education in Software Engineering.
          I was accepted into the UCD Advanced Software Engineering program (which took some convincing, <i>admittedly</i>).
          The course is aimed at giving industry experienced engineers a wider knowledge of software engineering.
          The program consisted of 7 intensive week long modules, with a mix of lectures, lab work and projects to complete at home.
          The program gave me exposure to many new languages and concepts. The intensive nature of the course meant having to pick up things very quickly, or be left behind. I only had one incident of a fraud-based panic attack while trying to
          prepare
          for a module. Fortunately, a colleague was able to set me right pretty quickly, once I reached out.
          Most modules were graded on a combination of the lab and project work, with some having an additional exam which was taken at the end of the year.
          There was also a dissertation project, where I learned I am probably going to be applying for a research Doctorate any time soon. Know your strengths, eh?
          The following were the headline subjects covered:
          <ul>
            <li>Design Patterns</li>
            <li>Performance of Distributed Systems</li>
            <li>Comparative Software Engineering Methods Process Frameworks</li>
            <li>Knowledge-Based Techniques for Industrial Systems</li>
            <li>High Performance Computing</li>
            <li>Computational Network Analysis</li>
            <li>Knowledge-Based Techniques for Industrial Systems</li>
          </ul>
          The course covered high and low level deveopment, design, refactoring, testing, machine learning, neural networks and experience in developing and testing with Python, Ruby, C, C++, jMeter, Azure Cloud
